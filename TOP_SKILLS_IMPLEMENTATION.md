### 📊 **Data Flow Architecture**

```
MongoDB Collection 
    ↓ (Aggregation Pipeline)
Backend API Endpoints
    ↓ (HTTP Requests)  
Frontend API Client
    ↓ (Data Processing)
Streamlit Charts & UI
```

### 🔍 **Database Queries Implemented**

1. **Role Categorization Query**
   ```javascript
   // Groups by job title and counts occurrences
   { $group: { "_id": "$data.title", "job_count": { $sum: 1 } } }
   
   // Then categorizes using keyword matching:
   // "developer", "engineer" → Developer
   // "data", "analyst", "scientist" → Data  
   // "designer", "ui", "ux" → Designer
   // etc.
   ```

2. **Skills by Role Query**
   ```javascript
   // Filters by role pattern, then unwinds skills
   { $match: { "data.title": { $regex: "developer|engineer" } } }
   { $unwind: "$data.tech_skills" }
   { $group: { "_id": "$data.tech_skills", "job_count": { $sum: 1 } } }
   
   // Same for soft_skills
   ```

### 🚀 **Current Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL**

#### ✅ **What's Working:**

1. **Real Database Integration**: All data comes from your MongoDB collection
2. **Dynamic Role Selection**: Dropdown populated with actual job roles  
3. **Interactive Charts**: Technical and soft skills visualized with real data
4. **Demand Scoring**: Calculated based on job frequency + company diversity
5. **Live Updates**: Data refreshes when role selection changes
6. **Responsive Design**: Charts adapt to different screen sizes

#### 🌐 **Access Points:**

- **Main Dashboard**: http://localhost:8501 (Top Skills section)
- **Test Interface**: http://localhost:8503 (API testing)
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/dashboard/roles
- **Skills API**: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/dashboard/skills-by-role

### 📈 **Example Data Output**

#### For "Developer" Role:
- **Technical Skills**: Java (24 jobs), Docker (22 jobs), AWS (21 jobs)
- **Soft Skills**: Problem Solving (44 jobs), Collaboration (38 jobs)
- **Demand Scores**: Calculated dynamically from actual job postings
- **Role Statistics**: 116 Developer jobs out of 167 total

### 🎯 **Key Benefits**

1. **Database-Driven**: No more static/fake data - everything from your collection
2. **Role-Specific**: Skills change based on selected job category
3. **Interactive**: Real-time filtering and visualization
4. **Scalable**: Automatically adapts as your database grows
5. **Accurate**: Demand scores reflect real market data

## 🔄 **How It Works**

1. User selects a role category from dropdown
2. Frontend calls `/dashboard/skills-by-role` API
3. Backend queries MongoDB with role-specific filters
4. API returns technical + soft skills with job counts
5. Frontend renders interactive charts with the data
6. Process repeats when user changes role selection

**The Top Skills component is now 100% functional and connected to your database!** 🎉
